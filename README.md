# Graph Network Visualization + Recommendation Engine

Collaborative Filtering and Force-Directed Graph Visualization

This project is written using python and d3.js

You have to run this simple server because of the Cross origin request error (the files are being server locally and hence no http calls are being made)

Here's what you should see:
