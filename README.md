# Graph Network Visualization + Recommendation Engine

Collaborative Filtering and Force-Directed Graph Visualization

The goal of this project is to explore concepts of non-negative matrix factorization and cosine similarity, as seen in some recommender systems so that I can take data scraped from Congress and recommend the best person to cosponsor a bill with for a congressman. This project will use python and d3.js but there are more specific requirements outlined.
